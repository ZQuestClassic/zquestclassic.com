# How to Play a Quest

The recommended way to play quests is via the latest stable version of ZQuest Classic for your operating system.

1. [Download the latest stable version of ZQuest Classic](/releases/)
1. [Search for a quest](https://www.purezc.net/index.php?page=quests) you like, download it, and place it inside the `quests` folder in the ZQuest Classic installation folder
1. Open zplayer, the player for ZQuest Classic quests
    * Windows: launch `zplayer.exe`; or use `zlauncher.exe` then click "ZC Player"
    * Linux: launch `zplayer`; or use `zlauncher` then click "ZC Player"
    * Mac: launch `ZQuest Classic.app` then click "ZC Player"
1. Use the arrow keys to navigate to `NEW FILE`, press Enter, type in a name for save file, then select the `.qst` file you wish to play
1. Press Enter to start the game

The default keyboard mapping for buttons `A` and `B` are "Z" and "X" - to modify this, or see what keys the other buttons are mapped to, open the system menu (just click the mouse) and select `Settings -> Controls -> Keyboard`.

Before closing the player, be sure to save. Some quests have special saving locations within the game world, but most can only be saved by opening the system menu (click the mouse), selecting `Game -> End Game`, then choosing the "Save" option.

## Alternative Method: play directly in the browser

You can also search for and begin playing a quest directly in the [web version](https://web.zquestclassic.com/play/). Open the `Quest List` at the top of the page, find a quest you like, then click the `Play!` link to start the game.

Note, the web version is still experimental, and may not work ideally in all browser or on older computers. For the most verified experience, use Chrome.
