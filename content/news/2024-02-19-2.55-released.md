Today marks the first non-alpha release of [2.55](/releases/2.55.0/). This should be the most stable modern release of ZC - big thanks to everyone that has diligently reported bugs. We'll still continue to patch serious bugs as they come up, but now the main focus is polishing the `3.x` branch, and making it as stable as 2.55 for 3.0 and beyond. For a reminder of the new versioning, see [the original announcement article](/news/2023-10-20-announcing-2.55-final/).
