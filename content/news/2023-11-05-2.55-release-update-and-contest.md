Instead of the [initially announced release date of November 7th](https://zquestclassic.com/news/2023-10-20-announcing-2.55-final/), we will be doing one last alpha release - Alpha 120. After this, there will be no more changes to 2.55 except for bug fixes (and if they are serious enough, we'll do hotfix releases for Alpha 120). We plan to do the final release in early December, giving plenty of time for bugs to be found, and for a [2.55 quest contest](https://www.purezc.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=78504). The winners of this contest will have their quest included in 2.55.

After Alpha 120, we'll begin making changes as part of 3.0. Nightlies after this alpha will be "3.0 prerelease", which shouldn't last more than a few weeks, at which point we will release 3.0 and adopt the new versioning policy. So, if you plan to participate in the above contest, you must use **Alpha 120**, which should release soon. Once that is out, _DO NOT_ use nightly releases marked "3.0" for the purpose of entering the 2.55 quest contest.

Happy quest making! ðŸŽ‰
